I had to use ChatGPT at the end.
I had an issue where the waiting times I got were too high that what I expected them to be.
All it amounted to was a single line that was like `if proc["arrival_time"] > currtime:`.
For all I know it's still broken, but it definitely *feels* more correct.

Did you know VI has support for italics for markdown? It italicize "feels" in the terminal!
